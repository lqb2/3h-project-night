3-hour project night is space and time for people building projects to co-work. It's basically a meetup but for people who want to work alongside other people pushing to produce something within the 3-hour time limit.

## When 

Every 2nd and 4th Wednesday. 

## Where

The location for each week will be posted here by Monday of that week.

## What do I bring?

Whatever you need to produce something within 3 hours. That might be your computer, pen & paper, whatever. Eat dinner beforehand or bring something with you. Or maybe we'll order delivery?

## How will it go down?

People will gather from 5:30-6. At 6, we'll do a quick go-around of names, how many times you've been to 3hpn, and what you want to have accomplished by 9p. Then we'll all just work alongside each other until 9. At 9, we'll do another quick go around and show each other or discuss what we did. Some work will be super visual and others will be best explained. All cool. 

That's it! Hope to see you at one soon.
