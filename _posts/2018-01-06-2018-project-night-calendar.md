Here's the schedule for all the 3-hour Project Nights for 2018. This is subject to change but hopefully it's helpful! 

Project night is always 6-9p EST and can totally be joined virtually. There are two times during the session (at 6 and again at 845p) where we all connect to say what we're planning on working on or what we accomplished (including what we didn't #failureisimportantdata)! 

If you're joining us virtually, we'll be meeting in this [call link on Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/call/MGcqcvQvOWLQwxEOL7slAAEE)
