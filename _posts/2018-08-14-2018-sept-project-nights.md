Project night is starting up again (after a many month hiatus) in September. 

## What's the point?

3-hour project night is meant to support people who have projects they want to work on but sometimes (often? always?) struggle to keep things moving forward. 

You bring something(s) to work on and for three hours, we all work side-by-side, mostly independently. There are two times during the session (at 6 and again at 845p) where we all connect to say what we're planning on working on or what we accomplished (including what we didn't #failureisimportantdata)! 

The main benefit is the accountability of a group. Sometimes it's just two people total, but it's been as large as six.
